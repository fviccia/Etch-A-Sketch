# Etch-A-Sketch
A Etch-A-Sketch style project using DOM manipulation.
This project is from The Odin Project Curriculum Web Development 101.

It's a basic interface that let's you choose a grid and play with it changing the colors of the squares with some options, a reset button to return to the first state and a erase button if you mess something up in your art work.

Thanks for watching and enjoy!
